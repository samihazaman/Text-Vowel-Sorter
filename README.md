# Text-Vowel-Sorter

In this project, I developed a GUI that reads in a text input file and efficiently sorts the words that starts with a vowel into an organized grid layout. The GUI has an intuitive File menu, allowing users to effortlessly select and load text files through seamless interactions with Open and Quit menu items. I have provided a sample text input file to try out the word GUI.
